# Water-rocket
This MATLAB-based project aims to model and optimize the dynamics of a water-air propulsion system in a bottle rocket. The primary goal is to determine the optimal water-to-air ratio and initial pressure for maximizing jet performance. Key predictions include:

Max Height: The peak height reached by the jet.

Max Velocity: The highest velocity of the jet at the point of propulsion.

Landing Time: The time it takes for the jet to return to the ground.

The project employs fluid dynamics equations to simulate the behavior of the system, considering factors like pressure, volume ratio, and air/water interaction. It uses numerical methods to compute the relationship between these parameters and predict performance outcomes.

Key Features:
Optimization of water-to-air ratio for peak performance.

Simulation of jet dynamics under varying initial pressures.

Visualization of the trajectory, velocity, and height.

Prediction of landing time based on system parameters.

Technologies:
MATLAB for modeling and simulation.

Fluid dynamics theory (Bernoulliâ€™s equation, conservation of momentum).

Optimization techniques for parameter tuning.

This project is ideal for understanding fluid dynamics in propulsion systems and can be applied to fields such as aerospace engineering and fluid mechanics.
